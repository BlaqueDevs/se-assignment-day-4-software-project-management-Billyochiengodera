## 3. Compare and contrast Agile and Waterfall methodologies. What are the main advantages and disadvantages of each?
- Agile is Iterative and incremental while waterfall is Sequential and linear
- Agile is highly flexible, changes can be made at any stage	while waterfall is rigid; changes are difficult once the project begins.
- In Agile there Continuous client collaboration while water there is	Limited client involvement.
- Agile is delivered in small and functional increments while waterfall is	delivered at the end of the project.
- In Agile testing is continuous throughout while in waterfall testing phase happens after development is complete.
- Agile requires minimal documentation; focuses on working software while waterfall extensive documentation required.
- Agile is adaptive and flexible to risks While waterfall  has higher risk of failure due to lack of flexibility.
  Advantages and Disadvantages
 Advantages of Agile Methodology:
- Faster delivery of functional components.
- High adaptability to changing requirements.
- Continuous customer feedback improves product quality.
- Early detection of issues through regular testing.
- Encourages collaboration between developers and stakeholders.

 Disadvantages of Agile Methodology:
- Difficult to estimate time and budget accurately.
- Requires high client involvement, which may not always be possible.
- Documentation may be overlooked.
- Not suitable for projects with fixed requirements.
- Can lead to scope creep if not properly managed.

 Advantages of Waterfall Methodology:
- Clear project structure and well-defined stages.
- Easier to estimate time, budget, and resources.
- Comprehensive documentation makes maintenance easier.
- Suitable for projects with fixed and well-defined requirements.
- Simple to manage for small or less complex projects.

  Disadvantages of Waterfall Methodology:
- High risk if requirements change during development.
- Late testing makes it harder to detect issues early.
- Client feedback is only incorporated at the final stage.
- Not ideal for long or complex projects.
- Delays in one phase can affect the entire project timeline.

## 4. In what types of projects might Agile be more beneficial than Waterfall, and vice versa? Can you provide examples of each?

## 6. How does defining the project scope contribute to successful project planning? What is a Work Breakdown Structure (WBS), and why is it useful?
How defining the project scope contributes to successful project planning
- Defines what the project aims to achieve, helping the team stay focused.
- Ensures all stakeholders have a common understanding of project deliverables.
- Helps avoid unauthorized or unnecessary changes during the project.
- Allows accurate estimation of project timelines and budgets.
- Helps identify potential risks based on project boundaries.
- Clarifies what resources are needed and when.
- Provides a baseline to measure project progress and success.

A Work Breakdown Structure (WBS) is a hierarchical decomposition of the total project work into smaller, more manageable components. It breaks down the entire project into work packages, tasks, and sub-tasks, making it easier to estimate costs, timelines, and resource requirements.

Why WBS is important
- Task Organization	-Breaks down complex work into manageable parts.
- Clear Responsibilities -Assigns ownership to individual tasks or teams.
